# Monopoly Assignment

## Overview:

This assignment will carry on where the labs have left off on our Monopoly game. You are allowed to take the game in any direction you want with a list of features you might consider included below (feel free to think outside the list as well).  

You are given 12 days to complete the assignment and the expected effort is 8 hours of work (about 45 minutes per day). The assignment is weighted as 5\% of your final grade.

## Due Date:

Tuesday April 1, 2025 at 10:00am. 

Late submissions are accepted as follows: 

- submissions after 10:00am on the due date, but before 2pm will be assessed a 10% penalty. 
- submissions after 2pm on the due date but before midnight will be assessed a 33% penalty.
- submissions after April 1 will be assessed a 100% penalty.

Grading will commence on April 1, in the labs. 

## Extensions

- Extensions are only granted in exceptional circumstances and must be requested no later than Friday March 28, 2025 and must include a copy of what you have completed on your project so far.
  - Failure to include your work up until that point will result in the extension being denied.

## Instructions:

Included here is the source code from the lab Monopoly project along with two text files in the text_docs directory. The text_docs are:

- walkthrough.txt - to be completed as a walkthrough of your contributions to the game (during this assignment) and how to experience those contributions. 
- ai_assistance.txt - to be completed as a document explaining how you used AI to assist in development of the game. If you choose to use AI assistance you should include the prompts you used, or provide a description of how you coded with a co-pilot and what aspects you "directed" and which it completed for you.

You may add additional files (especially source files) as you see fit. 

A select few ideas to help inspire what you may add to the Monopoly game or consider adding to improve the game:

*Note these are just suggestions: the assignment is meant to be open-ended to allow you to follow your interests. Some of these suggestions go well beyond the scope of the course, others could be completed in a couple lines of code.*

- Jail - go to jail square, roll doubles 3 times and go to jail, just visiting, get out of jail free cards, pay $50 to get out of jail, etc 
- chance and community chest cards - download the cards from the internet and implement them in the game - landing on chance or community chest results in drawing a card and implementing the effect 
- building houses and hotels when a player has a monopoly on a particular color group (selling houses at half price to raise money)
- charging double rent when a player has a monopoly but no building improvements on a property 
- trading properties, money and assets between players
- players can choose a token to represent them on the board
  - the tokens show up on the board in the correct location as the game is played
- players can choose their own names
- properties are auctioned to the highest bidder when a player declines to buy them
- improved graphical user interface for the board and players and what they own
- replace the tkinter frontend with a web framework like flask or django
- set-up screen to allow players to configure a new game
  - select players, tokens, house rules, etc
- implement a game timer to limit the amount of time a player has to make a move
- save and load games to a file 
- implement a computer player that can play against human players
- implement various strategies for the computer player
- simulate games between computer players to determine the best strategy
- implement a suggest button that tells the player what the best move is (always buy baltic, never buy baltic, etc)
- implement a chat feature for players to communicate with each other
- implement a leaderboard to track player performance over a number of games
- implement a game log that records all actions taken by players during the game
  - train an AI to play the game by reading the game log

## Expectations 

The expectations are that you will add 8 hours of work to this. It is not expected that you will complete all of the above features or the most complicated of the features or spend 25 hours or more. You are welcome to spend more than 8 hours and welcome to tackle anything you find interesting.

## What not to do

- Do not copy code from the internet (chat gpt is no issue just indicate in the ai assistance text file, but don't search github for random completed monopoly projects that you plan to hand in as your own work).
- Do not share your code with other students
- Do not use code from other students
- Do not email the professor to ask him to do the assignment for you

## Academic Integrity

The academic integrity policy is in effect for this assignment. For a first offense: failure to comply will result in a 0 on the assignment and a 5\% penalty on your final grade and a letter to the Dean. For a second offense the penalty is a zero in the course.

## Grading 

The assignment will be peer graded. You will grade up to 3 of your peer's work and subsequently your submission will be graded by up to 3 of your peers. The grading will be done in the labs during April 1 to 4. 

The grading will be based on the following questions:

1. is walkthrough.txt completed: yes/no
  if no grade is 0 and you are finished grading this work
2. is ai_assistance.txt completed: yes/no
  if no grade is 0 and you are finished grading this work
3. play the game and read the code base
   - on a scale of 1 (doesn't match) to 4 (perfect match) does the game play and code base match what you were expecting from the walkthrough.txt and ai_assistance.txt files
   1 2 3 4 
4. Does the effort required to complete the assignment seem to be 8 hours or more? On a scale of 1 (2 hours or less) to 4 (8 hours or more) indicate your perceived effort to achieve this work. 
1 2 3 4

5. Rate this work compared to your work. On a scale of 1 to 3 as follows:
  1: my work is superior to this work
  2: my work is similar to this work
  3: this work is superior to my work 

Your grade will be the sum of these scales (averaged) plus the inversion of the scores you assigned others on question 5 all out of 13 with a maximum grade of 13 (we will round any grades of 14 down to 13 to encourage altruism).

Example if others scored you as on average:

3. 3.3333 
4. 4.0
5. 2.0 

And you graded everyone's work as superior to yours on question 5 giving an average: 3.0 which inverts to 1.0 then your grade would be 3.3333 + 4.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 = 10.3333  / 13 = 79.5%

## Submission

Submit a single zip file of this completed project to moodle before the deadline.
